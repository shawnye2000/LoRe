                "description": "From the Manufacturer. The Succession Wars. is the highly anticipated sequel to the award-winning 1995 release. Heroes of Might and Magic. . Having crushed his enemies, consolidated his power base, and eliminated dissent at the end of. Heroes of Might and Magic. , Lord Ironfist settled down to rule the land of Enroth. After 25 years of peace, the land is again thrust into turmoil. Lord Ironfist is dead, and the ensuing battle for power between his sons, Archibald and Roland, has led to a state of war. Players must choose sides and summon their armies as they use all of their strategic wit and tactics in the battle for domination of the lands.. Review. In our March '97 issue (p79), we warned you against Heroes of Might and Magic, not because of the game, but because of the port quality. With the sequel, Heroes of Might and Magic II: The Prince of Loyalty, we can skip right to gameplay, because there's nothing wrong with this version technically.. The game mechanics haven't changed much from the original: You still control castles and heroes, and your goal is to take over the other castles and defeat all other heroes on the gameboard. There are six different types of heroes and castles - barbarian, sorceress, wizard, warlock, necromancer, and knight - which control different species of fantastic creatures - goblins, druids, golems, rocs, mummies, and calvary, to name just a few. Castles provide troops and the funding needed to hire them. To improve both troops and income, a hero needs to claim control of a variety of building materials scattered throughout the countryside. Improving the fortifications requires wood and stone and leads to better defense, whereas mercury, gold, and sulfur allow you to upgrade the mage tower which gives a hero more spells to cast. Opposing heroes vie for control of these resources.. The sequel adds more hero types (necromancer, wizard) and their associated monsters (vampires, halflings). There are more buildings on the playing field, and you can climb a tower to get a glimpse of the surrounding countryside, even of places you can't physically reach yet. The castles have been upgraded, with more options: You can build a captain's quarters, turrets and a moat for defense. If a hero isn't in the castle when it's attacked, the captain leads the defense. You can also upgrade the creature habitats: cavalry become champions, giants become titans, and liches become power liches.. Battle mechanics are slightly different from the original. Your hero gets a number of spell points, and once he or she runs out, no more spells may be cast. There are also some new battle spells: the \"death ripple\" is amusing to watch as it ripples along the screen, wounding all living creatures in its path. The death ripple can be countered with a \"holy word\" spell, which clouds the video and wounds undead creatures, such as vampires and liches. If your hero runs out of points, you can take him or her to a castle to recharge (but not during battle).. Completely new in the sequel are campaign intros which introduce the opposing forces. You can choose to play the good (outcast and honorable) or evil (in power but oppressive) side. We found the campaign scenarios difficult after the first few levels. If you get stuck, play a standard game, and work up to beating the expert levels at the highest difficulty rating, and then go back to the campaigns.. The game is zippy on a standard Power Mac. However, if you're running on a 68040, turn off ambient animations and computer opponent animation. Our only nit to pick with Heroes II is that we wish that ports would use the standard file dialog for saving and opening games, and that the light source for shadows was in the Mac-standard upper left corner. Still, if you're a role-playing or strategy fan, you'll have tons of fun with Heroes of Might and Magic II. - Kathy Tafel. Good News: Completely upgraded. Runs well on '040s. Better port than original. Fun for weeks, not hours.. Bad News: Nonstandard saving mechanism. RAM-hungry.. Rating:. 4/4. \u00a91999 MacAddict --. From MacAddict -- Subscribe now!"

The game is inspired by old-school games like Dungeon Master I and II, the Eye of the Beholder series and the more recent Legend of Grimrock I and II. Stranded in the middle of an ocean, in front of a gigantic tower, the hero must find out what the place is, what happened there, and most importantly, who he is.. Prepare to fight - you'll encounter many enemies along your path. Each type has a distinctive set of strengths, weaknesses, and attack and defence mechanisms, so you'll have to employ different tactics to beat them. Choose wisely when equipping yourself with gear; weapons differ from one another not only by damage levels and appearance, but also in terms of their unique bonuses or behaviours.. Use a wide range of skills thanks to the gadget-based RPG system: direct attacks, area attacks, offensive and defensive buffs, etc. But be careful, because while they are powerful, they also drain your energy. Remember that some enemies are immune to certain types of attack, so you will have to figure out the best way to deal with every encounter the game throws at you.. Solve intriguing puzzles and level-wide objectives where you will need to use both your wits and reflexes. While most riddles are contained in a single room, progression objectives can span entire levels, or even multiple ones.. Instead of increasing the abilities of your human character, improve your exoskeleton. Equip yourself with various items and define your own playstyle. Change your loadout at any time to adapt to all kinds of unexpected situations. As your exoskeleton becomes more powerful by absorbing a special substance - fumium - from defeated enemies, you will be able to unlock useful areas of the exo-rig, gaining significant permanent attribute bonuses and passive skills. Simply put - prepare for tonnes of customisation.. ."

Of course, this is not always possible since doing this as a ghost is orders of magnitude harder than when you are a human. However, some manage to do this and are able to spend the rest of their deaths in the afterlife. In The Outbound Ghost, your task is to help others fix or come to terms with their past lives so that they can enjoy the pleasures of eternal bliss. You must achieve that for yourself too, but it's not so easy to mend the mistakes of your past life when you don't even remember them."

                "description": "Truberbrook is a thrilling mystery adventure game set in rural Germany in the late 1960s. The player takes the role of young American physicist Tannhauser, who happens to end up in the eponymous village of Truberbrook, an ageing but beautiful health resort somewhere in the densely forested countryside of West Germany. Tannhauser, while working on his PhD thesis, comes to Truberbrook seeking to crack a tiresome mental block. But something in this town seems strangely spaced out, as the superficial German homeland setting gradually evolves into a puzzling sci-fi mystery. One of the most distinctive features of the game is its unique visual style: The whole scenery and all backdrops will be built as real miniature scale models, captured via photogrammetry, digitally polished and then blended with animated characters, visual effects and set extensions. Gameplay wise, Truberbrook is a somewhat classic point-and click adventure game with a modern approach. Mood and atmosphere of the game are inspired by TV series like Twin Peaks, The X-Files, and True Detective. The game mixes German folklore with a gripping sci-fi storyline, covering universal themes like love, friendship, loyalty, rootlessness, self-discovery and dinosaurs."

The universe takes place in a feudal fantasy Japan which is strongly inspired by the story of Takezo Musashi, whose adventures are unfolded in a series of books (mainly \"The Stone and the Sword\").. You play as Miyamoto Musashi travelling through a 17th century fantasy Japan, from north to south to the island of Ganryu-jima where everything started between Musashi and Kojiro.. After his victory against Kojiro, Musashi decided to meditate and try his hand at art, in the north of Japan, in the province of Hokkaido. During one of his meditations, a spirit contacted him : \"Miyamoto Musashi, our fight is not over, I am waiting for you to finish our fight once and for all! All of Japan will pay for your insult! I'm waiting for you Miyamoto Musashi!\". There is no doubt for Musashi that the voice was the Sasaki Kojir\u014d's one. His body was defeated, but his spirit remains, and his intentions are still destructive. Miyamoto Musashi then understood that he would have to travel across Japan from north to south and go to the island of Ganryu-jima, where he firstly defeated Sasaki Kojir\u014d, to fight again and liberate the spirit of Kojiro forever."

One of the most distinctive features of the game is its unique visual style: The whole scenery and all backdrops will be built as real miniature scale models, captured via photogrammetry, digitally polished and then blended with animated characters, visual effects and set extensions. Gameplay wise, Truberbrook is a somewhat classic point-and click adventure game with a modern approach. Mood and atmosphere of the game are inspired by TV series like Twin Peaks, The X-Files, and True Detective. The game mixes German folklore with a gripping sci-fi storyline, covering universal themes like love, friendship, loyalty, rootlessness, self-discovery and dinosaurs."

SimCity took the computer world by storm (well, by earthquake anyway), stretched the bounds of entertainment software and tore down the wall between fun and learning. With its simple interface, SimCity Classic is the best introduction to both simulation games and city planning on this or any other planet."

                "description": "Product Description The ultimate city simulator. You design, build, and customize any city you can imagine, and Sim City 2000 SE will bring it and its resident Sims to life. Includes the Urban Renewal Kit and Scenarios Vol. 1--all on one CD-ROM. GameSpot Review This is the most popular sim of all time, cranked up to a high-tech gloss and packaged with all the popular expansion sets. The original SimCity gave players the opportunity to create and oversee the growth of a living city as well as all its problems: crime, pollution, zoning demands, power outages, traffic foul-ups, and the occasional tornado, nuclear meltdown, or wandering monster from the sea. Less a game in the usual sense of the word than a sort of electronic ant farm, SimCity let players see how they fared as mayor, architect and town council. Now SimCity 2000 adds adjustable topography to the fun, using a terrain editor which can create mountains, valleys, ravines, etc. (The new types of terrain also permit the construction of hydroelectric dams and water towers.) Necessitated by this new addition is a new viewing engine, which rotates the player's municipality in 90 degree increments, so that new mountaintop university doesn't block your view of the burgeoning slum down below. As the town progresses through the decades, the sheer size and technological sophistication of your creations become more and more outlandish, and the resultant metropolis ends up looking like something out of Blade Runner. It can take quite a while to become familiar with Maxis' Sim series, and even longer to actually succeed at long-term city goals. Once you get beyond the learning curve, however, the cycle of planning, construction and urban renewal leads to a rewarding creation. And, as always, hard-won cities from earlier versions of the game can be imported for alteration and experimentation. --Chris Hudak/SpotMedia Communications --Copyright 1998 GameSpot Inc.

After a few years in retirement, jumping game giant Rayman returns with a new 3-D adventure game that will keep you hopping through several graphically stunning game environments. Fans of. Sonic. ,. Mario. , and other cartoon-like jumping games will probably enjoy the familiar gameplay of. Rayman 2. . While the French-created Rayman character may not be as recognizable as Sonic or Mario, he does bear a distinct animated look that will win over younger gamers. This strange cartoon creation manages to keep it together despite lacking any body limbs to connect its head, hands, and feet.. While younger players will appreciate the cartoon-like 3-D gaming environments, this game promises to challenge experienced gamers with 13 3-D game environments and 45 unique levels.. Amazon.com. Rayman 2: The Great Escape. packs more charm and surprises in a single level than most games can muster in their entire length. This 3-D platformer is designed in the same vein as. Super Mario 64. for the Nintendo 64 and the. Gex. series on the PlayStation. With the notable exception of. Sonic Adventure. , Dreamcast owners have suffered through a dry spell when it comes to action jumping games on the 128-bit system.. Rayman 2. was worth the wait.. The back of the case describes. Rayman 2. 's graphics as \"lush,\" but that may be an understatement. The game's environments and effects are impressive. We were awed by the amount of detail that has been designed into many of the game's environments. Perhaps more amazing is that the game suffers no slowdown despite the high-resolution visuals.. Pretty graphics aside,. Rayman 2. delivers solid gameplay that will suck in both casual and hardcore gamers. The controls are intuitive and special moves are easy to pull off. Rayman has a limited set of moves--basically he can run, jump, and shoot energy balls. Analog speed control is fully implemented, letting users pounce through a field of butterflies or tiptoe around a sleeping guard. Several puzzles are scattered throughout the game, but they are so ingeniously designed that you'll never feel overwhelmed by their complication.. We were hard-pressed to come up with many drawbacks to this game. One slight flaw is the camera angle, which can sometimes interfere with your ability to accurately control the on-screen action. Fortunately, this can usually be amended with a few quick presses of the camera control buttons. Other than that,. Rayman 2. is as good as it gets in this genre. Better still, Dreamcast owners get a special bonus: this version contains some extra levels you won't find anywhere else. If you have multiple systems, this is the version to get.. --T. Byrl Baker.

After patiently waiting more than a year between the announcement of the release date of Rayman 2 for the N64 and the actual release last November, fans eager for another serving of Ubi Soft's jointless platform hero were rewarded with an amazing platforming experience that truly showcased the N64. But what really surprised the gaming populace was the announcement that Rayman 2 was also in development for the Dreamcast and the PlayStation. And while the PlayStation version has yet to be released, the Dreamcast version is currently the best Rayman 2 available. Rayman has finally made the transition into a fully 3D realm, and although not as well known as Sonic or Mario, Rayman 2 proves that you don't have to have a hugely popular character to make a great 3D platform game. Evil mechanical pirates led by the maniacal Razorbeard are enslaving the population of Rayman's world. It's up to our jointless hero to collect four magical masks that, once united, will awaken a sleeping god who will help Rayman defeat the pirates. Along his quest he'll pick up lums, which are magical fragments of the world's energy core. He'll also free creatures enslaved by the evil pirates and run into a host of friends who will help him achieve his goal. Rayman 2 really immerses you in Rayman's world. The game offers stunning graphics, incredible sound, and tons of opportunity to interact with other characters. Almost immediately you'll run into Globox, an old friend who helps you escape from the pirate ship. From there, you'll encounter a cute fairy, a collective of tiny magical beings, a muscle-headed giant, an imprisoned whale, a polite water snake, and a few other surprising characters. They'll help you along the way by opening new routes, pulling you across chasms, giving you new powers, or even volunteering information. The graphics are simply astonishing. People taken aback by the N64 or PC versions of Rayman should really see him on the Dreamcast. The environments are lush, the colors are vivid, and the graphics are extremely crisp. There's absolutely no pop-up anywhere in the huge levels, and the game flows smoothly from one part to the next. You won't be truly impressed until you stand atop a ledge and switch to a first-person view, in which you'll be able to look down on the entire level without any hint of fog. Rayman himself looks great, and the character design is wonderful. The robo-pirates have just the right combination of menacing and doltish, Ly, your fairy friend, looks positively elfish, and Jano, the Keeper of the Cave of Bad Dreams, looks like he belongs in a nightmare. Rayman 2 is one of the most creative games to come along in a great while. Most platform games give you tons of ledge jumping and room exploring, with little deviation. Rayman 2, however, is packed full of different modes and minigames. From waterskiing, to swimming alongside a whale, to riding a rocket-powered horse, to flying a flaming powder keg, Rayman 2 is full of gameplay surprises. Indeed, there's plenty of platforming in Rayman 2, but the frequent use of different gameplay elements keeps the game fresh and exciting. Also, the game is very good at surprising you. While there are not a lot of objects in the game, there are several ways to use each. A powder keg can be tossed at bad guys, thrown at doors, used to break open cages, and even lit to create a rocket. This system always keeps you wondering what, exactly, you're going to do with an item you run in to. Rayman 2 is not only a treat to the eyes, but also to the ears. All the characters in Rayman 2 speak in their native language - a sort of quasi-French that comes out sounding more like gibberish than anything positively discernable. While each level has its own distinctive tune running in the background, certain scenarios will cause the music to change tempo, or even switch to a different track altogether, giving the game a truly interactive sound system. And if that weren't good enough, the music is actually really good. But that's not all the sound department has to offer. The sound effects in this game are great too. Detailed down to your footsteps, you'll hear every snoring pirate, every plink of your shoes hitting hollow metal pipes, every swinging cage, and everything else you'd expect if you were actually Rayman. Playing Rayman 2 without any sound is a difficult task indeed, as it's absolutely essential to the game. The control is so intuitive you'll wonder why other games even bother with bogging down the player with complex control schemes. You can jump, use your helicopter move to glide, shoot purple rings to swing, hold the left trigger to lock onto a target a la Zelda, and stand next to an object to pick it up. That's all you must do to get you through every level of Rayman. You won't need a complex item inventory screen, a lives count, or even much of a life bar, for that matter. With the wonderfully simple control and nothing more, Rayman 2 still manages to be a challenge without frustrating you with complex button presses or making you figure out what item to use where. Ubi Soft wasn't satisfied with simply porting the code over to the Dreamcast. Not only does it look better than the PC version, but it's also obvious the developers took their time making Rayman really take advantage of what the Dreamcast has to offer. There are new extra features, and Rayman 2 is now a multiplayer game. And if you explore the game's web site through the Dreamcast's browser, you'll find clues that lead you to a hidden Gloobox village, where you'll be able to play the Gloobox Disk - a multiplayer maze game. Rayman 2 is one of the best platforming experiences available today. By including a wonderfully humorous story, excellent game mechanics, and perfection in almost all other categories, Ubi Soft has created a game that appeals to all types of gamers. There are many versions of Rayman to choose from, but the extra features crammed into this version plus the Dreamcast's superior graphics and sound make this the Rayman game of choice for choosy gamers.. --Ben Stahl. --.

You will race beyond boundaries in this all-out world of high-powered sled racing with high speed, big drops, and criminally insane inclines. The screaming of the sleds competes with big industrial beats. Unique shortcuts, incredible track design, and cutting-edge machines take you into worlds of neck-and-neck arcade action. There are over 40 unreal sleds, each unique to individual riders, and upgradable as you increase in skill.. Review. Sled Storm. is a racing game involving motorized snow sleds--think. SSX Tricky. and then add a motor.. Sled Storm. feels very much like a derivative of its bigger sisters, and fans of the snowboarding series will feel right at home here. The action is fast and furious, the racing engaging, and there's even a trick meter that, when fully powered, allows ludicrously impossible stunts to be performed to great effect.. Sled Storm. looks, and plays, very nice. The handling of the individual sleds, which can be tweaked throughout the game, feels mushy at first, but soon becomes second nature, and the scenery is a delight to drive over, especially when it's accompanied by a suitably twangy soundtrack and some rather impressive expletives from the player's onscreen persona.. As you can imagine, the number of available tricks is limited by the nature of the machines, and is usually restricted to a few arm-waving maneuvers by the characters, with an occasional bit of leg action thrown in for good measure. This doesn't, however, detract from a gaming experience that can give you several good-quality hours of playing time. The only faults that can really be picked out are the measly seven racing courses and a limited number of playing modes. Cast these minor quibbles aside, however, and you're left with good, solid snow-racing fun.. --Chris Russell. --. Amazon.co.uk. See more"

Loaded with a mix of multimedia features and functions available on earlier PlayStation 3 models, as well as a series of new advancements and refinements, the PlayStation 3 160GB system is destined to push the envelope in the realm of Next-Generation entertainment. .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }. What's Under the Hood. As with previous models, the PlayStation 3 160GB system features an IBM \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed NVIDIA graphics processor that together allow the system to perform two trillion calculations per second. Yet the 160GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 160GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors. (The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience) This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 160GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from The Internet. Unlike other models of the PlayStation 3, the 160GB system does not offer backwards compatibility.. The same functionality now in a smaller, more quiet and energy efficient package. View larger. ..

PlayStation 3 utilizes the Blu-ray disc media format, which gives you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television, by way of the format's ability to hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This tremendous capacity, combined with the awesome power of the system's processor and graphics card, promises an endless stream of mind-blowing games, and other multimedia content. However, this does not mean that the PS3 is limited to Blu-ray discs - it also supports CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats. In addition, PlayStation 3 system software includes BD Live support that allows you to play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE). This means that you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format to obtain additional features. Of course, PS3 owners also receive free access to the PlayStation Network (PSN), where through the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home, they can download games, game demos, movies, and other content, as well as chat with friends, play mini-games, compete in tournaments and explore dedicated game spaces.. Sensational Controller. The Dualshock 3 wireless controller(one controller) included with The PlayStation 3 160GB system provides the most intuitive gameplay experience, with pressure sensors in each action button and the inclusion of the highly sensitive Sixaxis motion-sensing technology. Each hit, crash, and explosion is more realistic when the user feels the rumble right in the palm of their hand. It can even detect natural movements for real-time and high precision interactive play, acting as a natural extension of the user\u2019s body.

                "description": "The Order: 1886 is a deep, story-driven single-player experience that introduces players to a unique alternate history and a dark vision of a 19. th. century Victorian-Era London. It is the dawn of a new age, an age of scientific marvels, but underneath the dense London fog, in the shadows of the Industrial Revolution, enemies both old and new threaten to throw the city and the world into chaos. Watching over the city are humanity\u2019s only protectors, an elite band of Knights known as The Order, and the outcome of this struggle will determine the course of history forever.. Where History and Myth Collide. Set in a rich, detailed world that fuses real historical figures and events with new fictions and twists on familiar myths and legends, The Order: 1886 presents a unique vision of Victorian-Era London never seen before.. Centuries of Conflict. In this alternate history, a dangerous foe known as Half-breeds emerged centuries ago. In response to this new threat, an elite order of Knights formed to protect humanity from this deadly threat. Strengthened by a mysterious liquid called Blackwater, the Knights of The Order are able to heal their wounds and extend their lifespans in order to engage this supernatural foe.. It is the year 1886, and through the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, humans have advanced technology to gain an advantage in this war. Now equipped with powerful weapons to aid in their struggle, The Order is starting to turn the tide against the Half-breeds.. A New Threat Arises. While the Half-breed threat is pushed back into the shadows, a rebellion emerges that threatens an already unstable peace. Tight security measures that amount to a near police state, combined with a widening gap between the rich and the poor, have left the citizens of London angry at those they perceive to be the cause of their woes. The Rebels\u2019 ranks are growing, as is their boldness, as they declare an all-out war against The Order and the government oppression it represents. Now, the Knights of The Order must face threats on all sides as they struggle to maintain peace and order.. Danger Around Every Corner. Assume the role of Galahad, and engage both Half-breed and rebel as one of the most experienced Knights of The Order. Armed with a deadly array of advanced weaponry, utilize the third-person view and expansive cover system to float in and out of cover as you hunt your enemies.. The Right Tool for The Right Situation. Fire bolts of electricity to take out long-range targets with the Arc Gun, or rain down fire on enemies with the Thermite Rifle by dousing them in a cloud of flammable dust and igniting it with a superheated flare. The weapons of The Order: 1886 are all based on plausible science and technology.. Ahead of Their Time. Advances in technology have also helped The Order patrol the city and keep its citizens safe. Airships patrol the skies and are a constant reminder of the police state that controls Londoner\u2019s lives.. Every member of The Order wears a wireless device to communicate with each other and the airships that patrol the skies. A variety of gadgets aid them in the work, such as the monocular that allows the Knights to see across great distances, signal airships via Morse code and more.. Filmic Vision. Immerse yourself in the gritty world of The Order: 1886 through the stunning, cinematic presentation made possible with realistic lighting and rendering techniques and a visual presentation that mimics the nuances and imperfections of actual motion picture cameras and lenses. The dirt on the camera lens, the dust in the air and the light passing through broken and boarded-up windows all make for a more realistic and believable presentation.. Rich Storytelling. The cinematic experience is furthered by the deep, sophisticated narrative, featuring full performance capture for characters and scenes. Seamless transitions between action and story sequences work together to bring the rich narrative, rife with conspiracy, intrigue and betrayal to life.. Characters. Sir Galahad. You play as Galahad, an expert tracker and hunter whose instincts and skills, developed over the years fighting Half-breeds, are legendary among members of The Order. Jaded and numb to the violence he witnesses day to day, Galahad is world-weary with a calm, cool, professional demeanor. Prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Malory and mentor to Isabeau.. Sir Percival / Sebastian Malory. Sir Percival is a mentor and long-time friend to Galahad, and one of the few Knights who can match Galahad\u2019s strength and ability. One of the eldest Knights in The Order, he commands everyone\u2019s respect and is ready to work outside the bounds of the law when a situation calls for it.. Lady Igraine / Isabeau D\u2019Argyll. Under the tutelage of Galahad, Lady Igraine became the youngest member to ever be inducted into The Order. Now, as one of their most skilled and headstrong Knights, both she and Galahad share a mutual respect for each other.. Marquis de Lafayette. Recruited for his tactical genius honed during the American and French Revolutions, Lafayette serves as Sir Percival\u2019s apprentice and has become an invaluable member of his squad. At times impetuous, his passion for freedom and liberty is only equaled by his love of women.. Neo-Victorian London. The Order: 1886 takes place in a painstakingly recreated Victorian-Era London, which features familiar places such as the Palace of Westminster, Mayfair, Whitechapel, the Crystal Palace, Big Ben, and the London Tube. But take a closer look. This alternate vision of London features new advances in technology brought about by an accelerated Industrial Revolution and the centuries-old conflict between Human and Half-breeds.. Giant airships patrol the London skies and electric trains traverse the city on elevated tracks above busy streets. Amid this alternate history, The Order remains a pivotal part of the kingdom with its council hidden deep within the halls of the government\u2019s seat."

                "description": "Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin is an all-new Virtual Reality adventure that takes players back into the mysterious and paranormal world of the Psychonauts for the first time in over ten years! Includes a digital voucher for the classic original game Psychonauts! Once again players will assume the role of Raz, an intrepid young psychic and now fully fledged member of the Psychonauts an elite group of international psychic secret agents! The story picks up exactly where it left off at the end of Psychonauts (2005) with Raz, Lili, Sasha, Milla, and Coach Oleander flying off to rescue Truman Zannotto, the Grand Head of the Psychonauts. Their mission takes them straight into the heart of the Rhombus of Ruin a mysterious part of the ocean as deadly as two Bermuda Triangles back to back! When the rescue party itself is kidnapped and held prisoner in the Rhombus, Raz is immobilized and must use only his psychic powers to reunite his friends, reveal the identity of the mysterious kidnapper, and free Truman before the madness of the Rhombus consumes all their minds. In the experience players will see through Raz's eyes in first person, using his various psychic powers to affect the world, and solve puzzles. The power of Clairvoyance allows players to see through the eyes of others, and explore the environment, whilst other abilities such as Telekinesis and Pyrokinesis allow players to move things around with the power of their mind...or just set them on fire. Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin is written and directed by industry legend Tim Schafer, lead by VR Veteran Chad Dawson and created by many of the same people who worked on the original Psychonauts here at Double Fine Productions. Original voice actors Richard Horvitz, Nicki Rapp, and others are returning to reprise their roles, and original composer Peter McConnell will be writing brand new music for this brand new adventure!"

                "description": "Product Description.

From the Manufacturer. The fourth generation of hardware released for the PlayStation 3 entertainment platform, the PlayStation 3 160GB system is the next stage in the evolution of Sony's console gaming powerhouse. Loaded with a mix of multimedia features and functions available on earlier PlayStation 3 models, as well as a series of new advancements and refinements, the PlayStation 3 160GB system is destined to push the envelope in the realm of Next-Generation entertainment. .caption { font-family: Verdana, Helvetica neue, Arial, serif; font-size: 10px; font-weight: bold; font-style: italic; } ul.indent { list-style: inside disc; text-indent: -15px; } table.callout { font-family: verdana; font-size: 11px; line-height: 1. 3em; } td.vgoverview { height: 125px; background: #9DC4D8 url(https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/electronics/detail-page/callout-bg.png) repeat-x; border-left: 1px solid #999999; border-right: 1px solid #999999; padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; padding-bottom: 10px; width: 250px; font-family: verdana; font-size: 12px; }. What's Under the Hood. As with previous models, the PlayStation 3 160GB system features an IBM \"Cell\" processor and a co-developed NVIDIA graphics processor that together allow the system to perform two trillion calculations per second. Yet the 160GB system manages to improve on this with its 45nm version of the processor, which although running at the same 60+nm speed as previous PS3 versions, uses less energy. This makes the unit's smaller size and quieter fan possible. Along with the traditional AV and composite connections, the 160GB system also boasts an HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) port, which delivers uncompressed, unconverted digital picture and sound to compatible high-definition TVs and projectors. (The system is capable of 128-bit pixel precision and 1080p resolution for a full HD experience) This console also provides for an extreme sound experience by supporting Dolby Digital 5.1, DTS 5.1, as well as Linear PCM 7.1. Finally, it features cross connectivity with your PC network and PlayStation Portable (PSP) and its pre-installed, 160GB hard disc drive allows you to save games as well as download content from The Internet. Unlike other models of the PlayStation 3, the 160GB system does not offer backwards compatibility.. The same functionality now in a smaller, more quiet and energy efficient package. View larger. .. Space saving when placed upright.... View larger. .. As well as when horizontal. View larger. .. A textured, no fingerprint finish. View larger. .. Blu-ray, PlayStation Network Downloads and Beyond. PlayStation 3 utilizes the Blu-ray disc media format, which gives you the best high-definition viewing experience on your television, by way of the format's ability to hold six times as much data as traditional DVDs. This tremendous capacity, combined with the awesome power of the system's processor and graphics card, promises an endless stream of mind-blowing games, and other multimedia content. However, this does not mean that the PS3 is limited to Blu-ray discs - it also supports CD-ROM, CD-RW, DVD, DVD-ROM, DVD-R, DVD+R formats. In addition, PlayStation 3 system software includes BD Live support that allows you to play discs that support Blu-ray Disc Profile 2.0 (BD-LIVE). This means that you can also connect to the Internet while playing discs that support this format to obtain additional features. Of course, PS3 owners also receive free access to the PlayStation Network (PSN), where through the PlayStation Store and PlayStation Home, they can download games, game demos, movies, and other content, as well as chat with friends, play mini-games, compete in tournaments and explore dedicated game spaces.. Sensational Controller. The Dualshock 3 wireless controller(one controller) included with The PlayStation 3 160GB system provides the most intuitive gameplay experience, with pressure sensors in each action button and the inclusion of the highly sensitive Sixaxis motion-sensing technology. Each hit, crash, and explosion is more realistic when the user feels the rumble right in the palm of their hand. It can even detect natural movements for real-time and high precision interactive play, acting as a natural extension of the user\u2019s body. Dualshock 3 utilizes Bluetooth technology for wireless game play and the controller\u2019s detachable USB cable to seamlessly and automatically charge the controller when connected to the PlayStation 3. By integrating all of these features into the popular PlayStation controller design, the Dualshock 3 further enhances the advanced gameplay experience only available on the PlayStation 3 system.. Synch with Your Other Sony HDMI Devices. The PlayStation 3 160GB system features HDMI + Bravia Synch functionality. Bravia Synch allows connectivity between Sony HDMI products without having to utilize multiple remote controls. This means that with the push of one button, users can control compliant Sony devices connected to your PS3 via HDMI cable.. What's in The Box. :.
